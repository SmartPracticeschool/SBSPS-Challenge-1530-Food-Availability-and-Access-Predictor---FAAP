# SBSPS-Challenge-1530-Food-Availability-and-Access-Predictor---FAAP

## Description
The coronavirus pandemic will see more than a quarter of a billion people suffering from acute hunger by the end of the year. Risks faced my food security during the COVID-19 crisis have a major effect on disruptions in domestic food supply chains, other shocks affecting food production, and loss of incomes and remittances are creating strong tensions.
To solve this problem, we have created machine learning models that will predict the “Production” and “Demand” for crop yields considering the specified area and time. From the model predictions, one can estimate the demand and supply gap present in an area and will be able to take the required actions. As we can predict the future demand for products, it makes us control the supply chain and provide the products/goods at an affordable price to the consumers.

The main purpose of the model is to predict the demand and supply gap of the specified crop at a particular period, this will make the agriculture sector administration aware of any upcoming shortage of the stock of any commodity in the market in COVID-19 crises. This will help to prevent any shortage of the necessary commodity in the state.
People are dependent on markets for buying food and hence more vulnerable to price fluctuations and potential availability of the commodity. A sudden and sharp increase in prices of essential commodities will have a major effect on food security. Our model helps to understand food security problem and how it is even got worst with COVID-19 pandemic (crises within the crises)
